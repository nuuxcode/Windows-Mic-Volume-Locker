# Windows Mic Volume Locker
A tool to "lock" the mic volume in Windows, since apparently anyone and their mom can change it.

It's been a longrunning problem that some games and apps seemingly change the default mic volume at random, often resulting in annoyance and bleeding from the eardrums of anyone in a call with them.

This tool serves to fix that. While there's no way to officially "lock" the mic volume, this tool resets it to your desired value rapidly (every 0.5s by default), so that (hopefully) you stay at your normal volume.

To use, download a [release](https://github.com/wolfinabox/Windows-Mic-Volume-Locker/releases), and run it. To change the "locked" volume (default 75%), right click the taskbar icon, choose "Change Volume", and enter your desired volume percentage in the popup window. After that, it's pretty much set and forget
